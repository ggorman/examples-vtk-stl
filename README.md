# 3D Model Processing Tutorial with Python and VTK

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial designed to teach you how to process and manipulate 3D models using Python and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). VTK is an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization, widely used in scientific computing to handle complex geometrical data. This tutorial will guide you through reading, modifying, and saving 3D models, enhancing your understanding and skills in handling 3D geometries with Python.

## Prerequisites

If you're new to Python, we recommend downloading and installing [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) before starting this tutorial. VSCode is a lightweight, powerful open-source editor that supports Python development and many other programming languages.

### System Requirements

This tutorial is intended for users on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Git
- VSCode (recommended for beginners)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. If you are using VSCode, you can easily clone the repository using its integrated support for Git.

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to the View menu and click on 'Terminal' or use the shortcut ``Ctrl+` `` to open a new terminal.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Use the following Git command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggorman/examples-vtk-stl.git
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Setting up a Python virtual environment is crucial for managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts with other Python projects.

1. In the VSCode terminal, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
2. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install VTK as specified in the `requirements.txt` file, along with any other necessary packages in the virtual environment you created above.

## Starting the Tutorial

With all the setup complete, you are now ready to open the Jupyter Notebook in this repository and start the tutorial.

In VSCode, simply open the folder with the repo you cloned and double-click on the filename. Follow the prompts to select the virtual environment you created above.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience in processing 3D models using Python and VTK, which can be applied in various scientific and engineering contexts. Enjoy exploring the capabilities of Python in 3D graphics and visualization!
